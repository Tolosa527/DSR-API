MUSIC DATA ANALYZER AND API


This project was motivated by a challenge that I took from a learning page
in which I wanted to apply DRF. I created two endpoints: one for visualizing all the data
and the other one for filtering the data based on a percentile number that must be passed as a parameter.

TECHNOLOGIES:

PYTHON 3.9
DOCKER
DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK
SQLITE
DOCKER COMPOSE
REDIS

HOW TO START

This project was not an application that you are going to run, so I did not create an interface 
to run this either to run the project or to build the containers. 
If you know how It has a YAML file uploaded in the root folder and you can run `docker-compose up`.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 

This project use an auto documented tool provided by DRF. If you enter to the url:

- localhost:8000/api

This endpoint will response with the information you need to test it.
